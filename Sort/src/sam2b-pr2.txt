Assignment Overview:
(Describe your understanding of the purpose and scope of the assignment in 250 words or less. The word count is not strict, so don't worry about going slightly over. Do not just copy text from the assignment description.)


Technical Impression:
 re-factored SelectionSort( ) for LinkedList to re-use single instances of tempA and tempB, thus tremendously reducing the overhead of allocating and de-allocating memory.  I had no idea how bad it is/was to instantiate in a loop, or even create any new variable repeatedly in a loop.  But I'm still using nodeAt().
 
 re-factored insertionSort( ) for LinkedList to not use nodeAt(), and run times drastically improved since nodeAt() must traverse the list each time, up to 3n times in my previous implementation.

Unresolved problems in my submission:
(Use this space to list problems which you know exist in your submission. This could include program features which you did not have time to implement, bugs in your code, warnings generated by the tools which you did not understand or did not have time to correct, or other issues. I give a reduced grade penalty for problems which I find in your submission that are listed here and a larger penalty for those which are not. Just say 'none' if there are no issues that you are aware of.) 


Questions:
(Use this space to ask questions that you still have about the assignment, or just say 'none' if you have no questions at this time.)
